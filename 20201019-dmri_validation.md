# dMRI Validation Lit Review

This is a literature review for AINOSTICS on the use and validation of dMRI microstructure imaging techniques.


<a id="org9eddf2f"></a>

## Validation of microstructure techniques

The idea of this section is building a case for diffusion imaging and how the observed signal or the resulting maps/models relate to cellular biology and what is driving the signal being acquired. This can include work with synthetic, digital and tissue phantoms; animal and histology studies, etc.

## Application/added value of dMRI techniques

The idea of this section is how diffusion imaging derived parameters have been shown to offer value in diagnosing neurological conditions (with a focus on neurodegeneration), and any validation work around this.
